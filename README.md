# TempConversions
Temperature conversions, made using HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and AJAX

Second, final version of the temperature conversion PHP project. 
Worked with a team of people to create a fun and interractive tool. 
Credit where it's due: 
Sean Gilliland - Visuals and tester, 
Anthony Stenberg - Project Manager and tester, 
Zeke Lorens - QA and additional PHP conversion functions/statements (who later quit the team on the last day, leaving everyone to several hours of testing, correcting his code and math equations).
